    "The speaker didn't talk at all about using \"Raw NBconvert\" cells in his writeups.  Raw NBConvert cells are handled differently by the conversion process as well as pandoc.  Basically they just get dumped into the output file without thought.  It also seemed like the talk didn't really contain a whole lot of 'meat', and was more about how he wrote a book, struggled a lot with NBConvert, and found some solutions."
