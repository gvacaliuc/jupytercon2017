    "#### Scaling\n",
    "* Performance scaling (can accomadate ~4k **active** users/ hub)\n",
    "    * Used flame graphs using PyPy's performance debugger\n",
    "* Application scaling (as services)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proxy API\n",
    "* Proxy API allows any proxy service to be used as the proxy for the hub\n",
    "    * motivated by the fact that the traditional proxy is a single point of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MOAR servers\n",
    "* provides multiple servers per user at the same time\n",
    "* if the hub as access to an HPC cluster, users may want to launch a notebook server on the HPC instance, or maybe a GPU enabled compute node"
