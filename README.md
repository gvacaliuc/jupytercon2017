# Notes from JupyterCon2017

This is a collection of notebooks that comprise some notes I wrote during
JupyterCon2017.  The [tutorials](./tutorials/) section has a bit of code, 
as well as a Vagrantfile + some supporting files for deploying JupyterHub in a quick
VM.  For each of the sessions I put in some links to the relevant pages on the JupyterCon website,
but I don't know how long the site will stick around...
